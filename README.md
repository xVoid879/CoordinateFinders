# CoordinateFinders (Issues are stuff that I need to add)
Coordinate Website Source Code

Containing a Grass Block Texture Rotation Ai Analyzer and a cool Cloud Finder.

(The texture rotation AI will probably be useless soon due to fanda's impressive work. Clouds are still there but AI can easily take that over (Probably way easier than texture rotations which fanda has dne) so soon the website might be useless [Except for the pixel viewer which also might turn into AI, circling where it is] [Also the X Coordinate Tick Change thing that I will add later after the malfunction happened but that can be also easily be turned into AI. So it seems AI might take over coordinate finding soon.)
